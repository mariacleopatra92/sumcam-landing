POV shot of a warehouse worker walking down an aisle with an iPhone, 
the camera is pointed at cardboard boxes stacked on a pallet.
Each box has a white label with a printed weight number in black text.
As the phone camera detects each number, a green glowing outline appears around it.
The worker swipes right on the screen (seen as phone UI).
The detected number appears in a floating overlay in the top-left corner of the screen,
alongside a running total that updates in real-time.
The worker continues scanning multiple boxes quickly.
Cut to final screen showing "267 lbs total" with a green checkmark.
Cinematic, realistic, first-person perspective. 
Bright warehouse lighting, industrial environment.
Duration: 10-15 seconds. No audio or voiceover.
